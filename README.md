program that takes artists and uses yt-dlp to download music from youtube.
I wrote this program to generate playlists based on favorite artists. The program finds the top twenty songs and downloads them from youtube using a program called yt-dlp or youtube downloader plus. Then it converts the downloaded files to mp3 using ffmpeg. Both binaries ('yt-dlp.exe' and 'ffmpeg.exe') need to be in the script directory or in a system directory for the program to work. If there are many artists it will take hours to finish and if you abort early it may fail to convert them all to mp3 and name them correctly. I hope you enjoy it! I certainly have. :)
